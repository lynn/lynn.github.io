I'm playing some NetHack as [chordbug on nethack.alt.org](https://alt.org/nethack/plr.php?player=chordbug). I'm used to version 3.4.3 of the game, and now I'm trying to win some 3.6.2 games.

I'll keep a little diary of my attempts at winning various characters.

# Game 1

[Tou-Hum-Fem-Neu, killed by a soldier ant](https://s3.amazonaws.com/altorg/dumplog/chordbug/1572654057.nh362dev.txt)

An iconic first game, for sure.

Orcish Minetown, bad attack wands in Sokoban, shoddy armor options AC-wise. But Sokoban also had a ring of regeneration, and a pair of speed boots in an armor store made things look hopeful.

I sacrificed and got the Vorpal Sword, but then immediately ran into a nymph who stole my speed boots and regeneration ring. From there, things went downhill fast. I tried clearing the Sokoban zoo with the Vorpal Sword, but with positive AC and no speed, that went kinda poorly. I headed back deeper into the Mines, thinking I'd grab some more daggers or something, and died on the way there trying to Elbereth my way through a pack of soldier ants.

I should probably focus less on trying to hurry to the midgame, and collect more daggers as soon as I can.
