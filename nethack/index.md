I'm playing some NetHack as [chordbug on nethack.alt.org](https://alt.org/nethack/plr.php?player=chordbug). I'm used to version 3.4.3 of the game, and now I'm trying to win some 3.6.2 games.

I'll keep a little diary of my attempts at winning various characters.

# Game 1

[Tou-Hum-Fem-Neu, killed by a soldier ant](https://s3.amazonaws.com/altorg/dumplog/chordbug/1572654057.nh362dev.txt)

An iconic first death, for sure.

Orcish Minetown, bad attack wands in Sokoban, shoddy armor options AC-wise. But Sokoban also had a ring of regeneration, and a pair of speed boots in an armor store made things look hopeful.

I sacrificed and got the Vorpal Sword, but then immediately ran into a nymph who stole my speed boots and regeneration ring. From there, things went downhill fast. I tried clearing the Sokoban zoo with the Vorpal Sword, but with positive AC and no speed, that went kinda poorly. I headed back deeper into the Mines, thinking I'd grab some more daggers or something, and died on the way there trying to Elbereth my way through a pack of soldier ants.

I should probably focus less on trying to hurry to the midgame, and collect more daggers as soon as I can.

# Game 2

Tou-Hum-Fem-Neu, killed by a fire ant

Wow, ants are really scary. With new Elbereth, it's no longer viable to stand on a kajillion Elbereths and just throw daggers. You have to incur the ~23% risk of mis-writing Elbereth over and over again until it (maybe) kills you.

I need a better ant strategy, butâ€¦ The game doesn't really throw enough resources at me. Orcish Minetown again, no mithril. The only reason I managed to grab as many daggers as I did was because I was risky enough to venture into Orctown and start some fights, even though the orcs have very dangerous poisoned arrows. I survived an earlier soldier ant situation in the Mines only by reading a lucky unidentified scroll of teleportation.

The death itself is kind of silly: I'm fending off these ants, a dwarf shows up, I consider it not a danger, then accidentally let it waltz in and get a mattock hit in (oops). I fail two Elbereths and die terribly.
