      <h2>CV</h2>
      <h3>Academic</h3>
      <p><span class="when">2014&ndash;2018</span> I studied computer science at <a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/">UAntwerp</a>. I graduated <i>summa cum laude</i> and received a bachelor's degree. I achieved several 20/20 grades — a rarity in the Belgian education system.</p>
      <!--<p><span class="when">2016</span> I tutored mathematics to high school students for one semester, as part of a tutoring project organized by my university's diversity program.</p>-->
      <p><span class="when">2017&ndash;2018</span> I studied pure mathematics for one year while finishing up the last few courses of my computer science BSc. I ended up not finishing this degree because I&nbsp;got a job offer from Rainway.</p>
      <h3>Professional</h3>
      <p><span class="when">2018&ndash;2022</span> I helped build the future of personal cloud gaming at <a href="https://rainway.com">Rainway</a>. I&nbsp;got hired as a junior web dev, and quickly grew into a key role: I optimized WebRTC streams for low latency, invented a bitrate control algorithm, maintained an in-house port of Flutter to tvOS, and more.</p>
      <p>We even <a href="https://rainway.com/news/rainway-partners-with-microsoft">partnered with Microsoft</a>: my efforts helped bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to the browser.</p>
      <p>After the company pivoted fully to B2B, I was put in charge of the Web SDK. I communicated closely with customers about their performance and feature needs.</p>
      <p><span class="when">2017</span> Student job. I built a 3D graphics engine with VR support, using OpenGL and the Native C++ Oculus SDK.
      <p><span class="when">2016</span> Student job at <a href="https://www.rekencentra.be/">Rekencentra</a>. I helped create a React Native shipment tracking app used by a metal recycling plant.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Miscellaneous achievements</h2>
      <p>During high school, I tied for 3rd place in the <a href="https://www.vwo.be/vwo/">Flemish Mathematics Olympiad</a>, two years in a row (2013 and 2014).
      <p>In 2018, I won 2nd place in the <a href="https://www.dyalog.com/news/129/456/2018-APL-Problem-Solving-Competition-Winners.htm">Dyalog APL programming contest</a> for students, earning me a $1,350 cash prize.</p>
      <p>I created <a href="https://hellowordl.net/"><i>hello wordl</i></a>, an open-source replayable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle">Wordle</a> clone with over 200,000 daily visitors at its peak. I've been offered five figures for the domain, but I prefer to keep it ad-free.</p>
      <p>I'm <a href="https://code.golf/rankings/medals/all/haskell/all">extremely good</a> at writing short Haskell programs for sport, but I promise I won't do it at your company.</p>
      <p style="margin-top:4em"><a href="#top">return to top, so you can email me about that cool job</a></p>
