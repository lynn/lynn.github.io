1. Try to keep this place wholesome, welcoming and light-hearted. Before
sharing something heavy or bleak, or ranting about how bad a piece of news or
technology is, ask yourself if everyone really needs to hear it.

Of course, it's OK to be sad or worried, or need advice about something
serious! But ##lynn is not your doom-posting/sadness-dumping Twitter account.

2. NSFW links and convos go in our sister channel ##horney. XgF runs it.

3. I don't like hearing about chemistry and drugs and diseases and pathology
and chemicals, etc., sorry. It's a troublesome topic to me.

I know a lot of people here like discussing this topic extensively, and of
course it comes up a lot naturally in our social circle. If it does, please
consider moving the conversation over to ##edef, which I hear is a bit like
##lynn but with more syringes. Many folks who idle here idle there too.

Consider this a very light rule! I obviously won't mind if you idly chat about
hormones or meds you take in here. Just be aware that ##edef exists, for
heavier pharma nerd talk that may arise.

Disobeying these guidelines doesn't make you a bad person -- it will only get
you reminded of them. I'm simply aiming to describe what this place is about.
Please don't stress yourself out trying to obey a text file perfectly!! â™¥
