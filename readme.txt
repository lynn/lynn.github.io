1. Try to keep this place wholesome, welcoming and light-hearted. Before sharing something heavy or bleak, or ranting about how bad a piece of news or technology is, ask yourself if everyone really needs to hear it.

Of course, it's OK to be sad or worried, or need advice about something serious! But ##lynn is not your doom-posting/sadness-dumping Twitter account.

2. I really, really don't like hearing about drugs and diseases and pathology and stimulants, etc., sorry. It's a very troublesome topic to me.

I know a lot of people here like discussing this topic extensively, and of course it comes up a lot naturally in our social circle. If it does, please consider moving the conversation over to ##edef, which I hear is a bit like ##lynn but with more syringes.

Consider this a very light rule! I obviously won't mind if you idly chat about hormones in here. Just be aware that ##edef exists, for heavier pharma nerd talk.
