# Everything I know about Japanese pitch accent

Japanese is a "mora-timed, pitch-accent language".

Mora are like syllables, but smaller. Every mora takes the same amount of time to say: a word like にっぽん (Nippon) sounds like two syllables, but instead it's thought of as 4 mora (ni-p-po-n). Kana _mostly_ correspond to mora one-to-one, except for glides like きゃ, にゅ, しょ, etc. — those are one mora each.

"Pitch accent" means that the pitch of your voice when pronouncing these mora (like "low-high-high-low") may determine the meaning of a word. For example, "kaeru" meaning "frog" is pronounced "low-high-high" (ka-**E**-**RU**), but in the sense of "to go home", it's pronounced "high-low-low" (**KA**-e-ru).

Japanese textbooks have a nasty habit of pretending that this "pitch accent" does not exist. Some respected educators think that it's not worth teaching, for a variety of reasons (that I don't think are very good).

Because of this, pitch accent has been sort of a "fad" in online Japanese learning communities. Is it important? Should I learn it? I think it has the image of being an obscure aspect of the language that only obsessive diehards should spend time on. But I actually believe it's a _boring and normal and essential_ aspect of Japanese pronunciation, and its obscurity is undeserved.

So, I want to write everything I know about Japanese pitch accent into this document.

## Myths
#### You will be understood with incorrect pitch accent, so you might as well not bother.
Yes, native-speaker listeners are pretty good at _correcting for your pronunciation mistakes_ in their head while listening and figuring out what you're talking about. I think this isn't a very good excuse to be satisfied making those mistakes: you could throw this argument at any part of the language ("始まる vs 始める? Oh, just pick randomly, you'll be understood").

#### Pitch accent varies a lot by dialect, so there's no one "universal" accent for a word — so you might as well not bother.
The bit about geographic variation is true, but that doesn't mean it sounds correct when your pitch accent is all over the place. And anyway, dialects aren't really relevant. I assume that you are learning Standard Japanese (as heard in Tokyo or on the NHK), so the Standard Japanese pitch accent is relevant to you.

#### You can just sorta absorb it by copying native speech.
I think if this was true, it wouldn't be such a rich topic to make YouTube videos about :) I can only speak for myself, but my native language doesn't have a pitch accent, and [categorical perception](https://youtu.be/Qh8QlfYLUO0?t=140) means my brain isn't attuned enough to pitch contours to reliably copy them without thinking about it. [Yudai Sensei says](https://youtu.be/gzW5z_dYXTg?t=212) he hears a lot of learners say negative verb endings wrong (❌ ta-**BE**-**NA**-i, instead of ta-**BE**-na-i), and I was one of those for a long time. I clearly hear a lot of negative verb endings, but I hadn't ever noticed the accent! Actually, the pitch accent of verb conjugation is pretty complicated, and I don't think any adult learner could pick it up without some dedicated study.

#### Japanese is difficult enough already, so you had better spend that time on something else.
C'maaaahn you're gonna learn 2136 kanji but draw the line at "**HA**-shi"?

Well, I can't tell you how to use your time, but it would really bo-**THER** me if my eng-**LISH** sounded like this. I think the impression that "pitch accent takes an unduly long time to master" is supported by how most people discover it too late, and now it's this huge unaddressed gap. Take it little by little! Start saying "ko-**RE**" and "**NA**-ni" right and work your way up.

## Overview
Standard Japanese has only two pitch levels, low and high. Words either have a "stressed mora" (also called the "accent nucleus"), or they don't:

* If there is no nucleus, the word is "flat type" (heiban-gata 平板型), and it's pronounced in a "low-high-high-high…" pattern, where the high pitch continues into any particle that follows.
  * For example, 水 mi-**ZU**  →  水を mi-**ZU**-**O**.
* If the stress is on the **first** mora, this is "head-high type" (atamadaka-gata 頭高型). The pattern is "**HIGH**-low-low-low…" and the following particle is low too.
  * For example, バナナ **BA**-na-na,  バナナを **BA**-na-na-o.
* If the stress is on a **later** mora, this is called "middle-high type" (nakadaka-gata 中高型). The pitch starts low, then is high until the stressed mora, after which there is a drop again.
  * For example, 株式会社 ka-**BU**-**SHI**-**KI**-**GA**-i-sha. 
  * A subtype of this is "tail-high type" (odaka-gata 尾高型), where the stress is on the **last** mora.
   * For example... 妹 i-**MO**-**U**-**TO**. That looks exactly like heiban! But *the following particle is low*: 妹と i-**MO**-**U**-**TO**-to.
