# Myths about Japanese pitch accent

Japanese is a pitch-accent language. There are words like 飴 [amé] and 雨 [áꜜme] distinguished only by pitch contour.

That's all! Like, this is a relatively boring, but _essential_ aspect of Japanese pronunciation. If you get it wrong, it's wrong.

However, textbooks largely neglect to teach it, and sometimes don't even point out that it exists. This has given pitch accent a mythical "fad" status in Japanese learning communities, as if correct pitch accent is some secret separate skill for die-hard learners only.

Should you learn it? **Yes**, undoubtedly, if you want to pronounce Japanese correctly and have smooth conversations in Japanese. If Japanese learning materials were more like those for other languages, you wouldn't even be questioning it. Here are some English words in a random English textbook that I found photos of online. All words are introduced with their stressed syllable underlined:

There's simply no reason it should be any different for Japanese. I hear a lot of strange myths about why it is, and I will try to debunk them.

### You will be understood with incorrect pitch accent, so you might as well not bother.
Native Japanese listeners are good at _correcting for your pronunciation mistakes_ in their head while listening and figuring out what you're talking about. I think this isn't a very good excuse to be satisfied making those mistakes. You could throw this argument at any part of the language ("始まる vs 始める? Oh, just pick randomly, you'll be understood").

### Pitch accent varies by region, so there's no "universal" accent for a word, so you might as well not bother.
The bit about geographic variation is true, but that doesn't mean it sounds correct when your pitch accent is all over the place. And anyway, dialects aren't really relevant. I assume that you are learning Standard Japanese (as heard in Tokyo or on the NHK), so the Standard Japanese pitch accent is all that's relevant to you.

English has such variation too (**ro**-tate in the US, ro-**tate** in the UK). It doesn't matter. Textbooks teach the correct stress for whichever variety of English they teach.

### It's sufficient to adopt a "flat" prosody.
Of course not: for the same reason that no trivial rule, like pronouncing every word with initial stress, can produce correct English pronunciation.

### You can just sorta absorb it naturally by copying native speech.
I fear this is just not true. If it was this simple, there wouldn't be so many books, forum threads, YouTube videos, et cetera about it.

[Categorical perception](https://youtu.be/Qh8QlfYLUO0?t=140) means a mature English speaker's brain is no longer attuned enough to pitch contours to reliably copy them without thinking about it. Maybe if your native language has pitch accent, you'll have better luck.

[Yudai Sensei says](https://youtu.be/gzW5z_dYXTg?t=212) he hears a lot of learners say negative verb endings wrong (❌ ta-**BE**-**NA**-i, instead of ta-**BE**-na-i), and I was one of those for a long time. It was a shock to me: I clearly hear a lot of negative verb endings, but I hadn't ever noticed the accent!

[Even Dogen agrees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_zAnpkh25I) that learners do not normally absorb pitch accent patterns correctly without conscious study.

### Japanese is difficult enough already, so you had better spend that time on something else.
~~You're gonna learn 2136 kanji but draw the line at "**HA**-shi"?~~

I can't tell you how to use your time, but it would really bo-**THER** me if my eng-**LISH** sounded like this.

Learning a language is difficult. Good vocab, good grammar, and good pronunciation _all_ help you be understood more smoothly. I think the impression that "pitch accent takes an unduly long time to master" is supported by how most people discover it too late, and now it's this huge unaddressed gap. Take it little by little! Start saying "ko-**RE**" and "**NA**-ni" right and work your way up.
