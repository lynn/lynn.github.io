**I think** computers should beep. Put this in `~/.local/bin/bip` if you agree:

```bash
#/usr/bin/bash
notes=()
delay=()
d=0
for a in "$@"; do
  notes+=(sine $a)
  delay+=("${d}s")
  d=$((d + 3500))
done
play -qn -c1 synth 1 ${notes[*]} fade 0.01 0.1 0.06 delay ${delay[*]} gain -24
```

Now you can run `long_command && bip C4 D4 G4`, for example. I use it in my `.claude/settings.json` to have Claude chirp at me, with different little melodies depending on what it wants.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {"hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bip D5 F4" }]}
    ],
    "Notification": [
      {"matcher": "permission_prompt", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bip D5 E5" }]},
      {"matcher": "idle_prompt", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bip A4 B4 A4" }]}
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {"matcher": "AskUserQuestion", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bip D5 E5" }]}
    ]
  }
}
```
